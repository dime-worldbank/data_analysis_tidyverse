# Tidyverse Presentation by DIME Analytics

This repository contains the materials for a presentation on the `tidyverse`, provided by DIME Analytics. The `tidyverse` is a collection of R packages designed for data science that makes it easier to import, tidy, transform, visualize, and model data. This presentation was largely inspired by the works of Florian Oswald and Mylene Feuillade.

## Presentation Workflow

The presentation walks through the tidy data workflow, demonstrating the use of `tidyr` and `dplyr` for data manipulation and `ggplot2` for data visualization. Each step is clearly explained with examples and the rationale behind each action.
The presentation follows the following structure. 

#### Table of Contents

1. Introduction
2. Tidy Workflow
3. Tidy Verbs
4. Data Visualization
5. Conclusion and References

## Example Scripts

You can find the R scripts used for the examples shown in the presentation in the `example` folder. These scripts provide a hands-on approach to understand how `tidyverse` functions can be applied to real-world data.

## Resources

The presentation draws upon a wealth of resources:

- The original slides by Florian Oswald and Mylene Feuillade are available [here](https://raw.githack.com/ScPoEcon/ScPoEconometrics-Slides/master/chapter_tidy_programming/chapter_tidy.html#2) and the GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/mylenefeuillade/ScPoEconometrics-Slides/blob/master/chapter_tidy).

- Hadley Wickham's chapter on data transformation is a must-read for anyone working with `tidyverse`. Access the chapter [here](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/transform.html).

- The dplyr cheatsheet can be found [here](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/master/data-transformation.pdf) and the tidyr cheatsheet [here](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/main/tidyr.pdf).

- A gentle introduction to ggplot2 by Garrick Aden-Buie is available [here](https://pkg.garrickadenbuie.com/gentle-ggplot2/#1).
